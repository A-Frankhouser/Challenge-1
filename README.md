Challenge-1

Project description: 
	This project was made to use the skills we learned in week one of this bootcamp course. This included making a github repository and bringing that file onto our local computer. After that we had to use the starter code that was given to us on either our dashboard or in git labs.
	After viewing the index.html and style.css file we had to correct and consolidate the code in it. 
	In the index.html file, I made it more semantic by adding figure, article, gisection, footer tags, etc. Doing this made it easier to navigate the file and to understand it more. Also in this file I linked the “hero img.”, because it was originally in the CSS file and I wanted to have all my images in my index.html file. One of the last things I did in this file was to change the classes for the items in the content class and sidebar class. I did this so in CSS I could get the same design for all the sections in these classes. This consolidated a lot of repetitive code in CSS. In the head section, I also added a title that would make it easier to differentiate what this tab was if I had multiple tabs open in my web browser.
	In the style.CSS file I added some comments to make it easier to navigate throughout the file and understand what each section of code is for. Also, as I explained in the previous paragraph, I consolidated some of the more repetitive code in CSS.
